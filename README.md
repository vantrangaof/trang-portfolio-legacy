## Hello, I'm Trang!

I'm a self-taught frontend developer.

This legacy portfolio, my very first, was crafted in 2021 just a few months after I embarked on my self-taught coding journey.
While it may not be flawless, it represents a pivotal milestone in my career - one that ultimately led to securing my first professional role in the tech industry.

I realized that I had never maintained a repository for it! Yes, in the early days, I don't even know what GitHub is.
So here it is - updated in 2024 with some refactoring.
